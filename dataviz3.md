# Wireframe Phase 
## Here is my first attempt of solution
According to my assessments, I think there are three aspects for line charts to improve:
- Intuitivity:
..Use legends of contrast color to categorize different age groups 
..Add message titles and notes to impress readers with limited epidemic knowledge

- Perceptibility:
..I would differentiate the older adults with the teenage HIV/AIDS incidence rates.
..Highlight the focus groups (older adults)and add trend line of all population rates.

- Engagement:
..Just for experiemental phases but I would make animation on my plot so that it can move across time.

## Here is my second attempt of solution
After the first round feedbacks from my friends, I decide to make some necessary changes to my line charts:
- I put the intepretation of death per population as my subtitle and change the age group 15-49 to be more reasonable.
- I change the verticle solid gridlines into dashed horizontal gridlines.
- I add a toolip to demonstrate the detailed statistics of each year by different age group.
- Highlighted the older adults group and use red and green to categorize them.

# Test the solution Phase
I conducted two rounds of interviews from three reliable friends: Jimmy, Andie and Yang. I really appreciate their high-quality and useful feedbacks. Here are some comments and suggestions, I found their perspectives are quite different from my view. For example, Jimmy is really picky about my message titles and he really want my title stand out. I rarely notice that.

## Feedback from first attempt

- Context: 
> clear titles but lacking detailed information: what does "death per 1000,000" mean? (Jimmy)
> It doesnot make sense that people who age between 15-49 has the lowest incidence death rate! (Andie)
> I understand this is trend analysis, but where is your x-axis label? (Yang)

- Layout:
> It's better to use curve line rather than regression plot.(Andie)
> The x and y axis is not necessray but the gridlines should be added so people can compare the death rates across years.(Yang)
> Maybe change the color because they are a bit cheerful...The intended audience are patients and researchers.(Jimmy)

## Feedback from second attempt
- Context: 
> Why not change titles into “older generation has higher HIV/AIDS incidence death risks”?  (Jimmy)
> It's easier to understand your illustration than last time from the legends. (Andie)
> I understand this is trend analysis, but where is your x-axis label? (Yang)
           
- Layout:
> Put the explanation of death rates in the notes below the charts (Andie)
> I really like the current layout, you can add add line symbols to specify the start and end point if you like.(Jimmy)
> I found it confusing about the "all population line" Is that a trendline or an indicator, I think they should be different from other line type. (Yang)

# Recreated data visualization Phase
When I downloaded the raw dataset from the Global Health Data Exchange Database (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool) I found that my critique visualization only extracts partial data, for example, they have comprehensive datasets form 1991 to 2017, and by country and gender. But my selected visualization only presents it in a 12-year span. They have other indicators such as incidence cause, location and measure. I decide to choose the death rate by different age group as my recreation. 

<iframe title="Chinese Older adults has higher HIV/AIDS death risks&amp;nbsp;" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-NMHG7" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NMHG7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="454"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();

## Takeaway from the Observations
We can find that the The annual death rates of diagnosed HIV/AIDS among total population is increasing in China, yet HIV/AIDS in older adults has received little attention.There is sharp increases in modeled rate of HIV were observed among female aged 50–59 years and 60–69 years, as well as male aged 60–69 years and 70–79 years. Significant differences in changing trends and patterns of death rates HIV/AIDS were found among different age groups, especially between young adults and old adults. The annual average rates in children aged 5-14 years remained constant and the lowest across other age groups, the death rates of chidlren under five is also decreasing, which indicates the successful prevention of maternal infection. 

However, a sharp increase in death rates was observed among older adults aged 60–69 and 70–79 years. The results were consistent with other studies about the higher risk of HIV/AIDS among older adults at the national, provincial, and local levels in China. Older adults are often less educated and have not been the target populations for long-term HIV/AIDS control and prevention efforts in China. Their concerning upward trend tells us that health education and other effective measurements might be used to prevent HIV/AIDS among this group.

..1. A link to the original data visualization (or screenshot - make sure to correctly cite your sources, etc.).  Include a short paragraph on why you selected this particular data visualization.  For obvious reasons, the data visualization you select should come from a publicly accessible source.  

..2. A couple paragraphs describing what your process was.  You should include a few insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, if anything.  You should talk about how you moved next to the wireframes, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  If it led you to change anything about your data visualization's design, mention what that was.  Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently. 

You can also include screenshots of your wireframes or other artifacts with your narrative if it helps tell the story of how you moved through the process.
