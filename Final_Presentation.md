# Part III: Behind the Scenes
## Final Data Visualization 
[Map the inequality of global road safety](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/pedestrians-safety-matters/index.html) 

## The idea behind the visuals
+ The **project outline** can be found [here](https://kaiqingy.github.io/kaiqingy_repository/Proposal.html), I made some necessary changes to the original outline because I realize the audience think my data analysis is not sufficient enough to support my recommendation, so the reivised **project goal** was to summarize the findings and call for more people focus on the risky areas or behaviors, and deliver their demands to the policy makers rather than give recommendations on my own. The **project structure** can be comprised of four parts: 
+ opening speech(big numbers)
+ inequality across region, income levels and road user type
+ analyze the high death rates in low-/middle- income countries
+ map the regulation enforcement level in the risky factors
+ summarize findings
+ call for action. 
Because the dataset include each country's regulation performence, so mapping the engagement level on a global scale would be a great idea. As for the exploratary analysis, I have some assumptions about the relationship between death rate and income category, so I tried different methods, like scatter plot, group donouts and bar plots to describe the interesting phenomenon.

## Data Source
+ The data source is adpated from the World Health Organization Transportation Database, we can access the datasets at [here](https://kaiqingy.github.io/kaiqingy_repository/Proposal.html). I use the Table A2 Road Traffic Deaths, mobile phone laws, speed law and helmet tables to create my visuals. The datasets has cleaned pretty well and it categorize the indicators by country and assign them with different level, but I think it will be helpful to add more regional characteristics. So I add another column to label each country with five regions: Asia & Pacific, Arab States & Middle East, Europe, North America, Latin America.

## Design and User Research
+ The sketches and storyboard, wireframes and findings can be assessed [here](https://kaiqingy.github.io/kaiqingy_repository/Wireframe.html). I have to say there are many changes and updates in my second wireframes after receiving valuable feedbacks. I value my audience's support and time to listen to my story a lot!

## Intended Audience
The intended audience for the road safety issue should be people who are concerned about risky behaviors on the roads or road designs, World Health Organization Research Fellow, or practitioners or legislators in road safety or vehicle manufacturering process. I hope to: 
+ Educate public about the risky behaviors that they thought it's not risky, such as cell-phone usage while driving. 
+ Deliver message to legislators to strengthen the regulation or penalty to increase the accountability of the regulation.
+ Prompt government offcials to collobrate with similar countries who made progress on mitigating the risky behavior, and implement some cost-effectiv measures to construct safer road for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and motorcyclists.

## Lessons Learned
+ Practice your one-minute lightning speech! I made an appointment with Global Communication Center to practice my pitch, the instructor (Person) reduce my time from 2.5 minutes to 1 minute. I successfully made it! The key was to create a draft for your speech and practice it beforehand.
+ Peer review is very necessary before finalizing visuals. Everyone has unique aesthetics or design ideas, your intended call for action might not sound reasonable to other people who are not familiar with this topic or not from your expertise. Some of my friends always give me many useful feedbacks on my visual design, or ideas on how to illustrate the ideas smoothly or directly. 
+ Call for action is hard but meaningful. I was struggled at the beginning because my exploratory analysis can not lead to actionable recommendations to improve the road safety. There's so much to do... But I could not cover the wide range within such a short time. I thought my "superficial" analysis will not lead to any conclusion. Until a mentor from GCC suggests me to use one sentence to summarize the takeaway, then I realize I want to increase public awareness about road about risky behaviors. That's indeed meaningful call for action. So I switch for my focus from my recommendation to useful findings and promote more public awareness campaign. It seems to be resonable and sufficient to support my previous background analysis.
