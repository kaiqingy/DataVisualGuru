# About me

My name is Kaiqing (she/her/hers), I'm the second-year public policy management student of Heinz College at CMU and I'm graduating this May(Cheers). People call me "warm-up queen" because it takes me very quick time to make new friends and I use this talent in bargaining. I am a yoga fan and balance is my key to handle all kinds of challenges, especially the peer pressure at CMU. In the future I hope to engage in digital marketing industry and utilize data visulization skillsets to analyze the market trend and propose some insightful ideas to persuage my future clients/managers.

# What I hope to learn

Github is new world to me, and I found it magical. It's a great platform to display past work and track my progress. I used Power BI and Tableau in my previous client project but never have a chance to evaluate it except for my clients' feedback. This course offere me a brand new viewpoint to critique the data visualizations systematically and I hope to set a higher a standard to redesign some of my previous work and make it use in my capstone project and future work.
