# Wirefames for user feedback
Your storyboards should be a visual walk-through of the primary elements of your outline, tying in your sketches where appropriate to illustrate how you intend to lead the reader through your experience.  These can either be hand-drawn or can be created digitally using Balsamiq or another tool. 

I created a prototype using Basamiq tool and decide to guide audience by steps how to map the inequality of road death step by step. Data resources and Agenda slide were not wireframed here due to time limit, and there are limited visual options to choose to from Basamiq, so I tryied to illustrate some of the visuals by text here. The main goal of the sketch is to engage the audience with some interesting stories with data and call for action to raise the road safety awareness.

In the background slide(page 3), the downward errows are representing the SUDG Road death rate goal by 2020, unfortunately I failed to choose apporpirate icons to present that and it might casue confusion.

![Recommendation](Recommendation.jpeg)
The message title in recommendation slide(page 8) should be "recommendation to improve th inequality of global road safety issue." The words are filtered somehow.
