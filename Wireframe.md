# Wirefames for user feedback
Your storyboards should be a visual walk-through of the primary elements of your outline, tying in your sketches where appropriate to illustrate how you intend to lead the reader through your experience.  These can either be hand-drawn or can be created digitally using Balsamiq or another tool. 

I created a prototype using **Basamiq** tool and decide to guide audience by steps how to map the inequality of road death step by step. Data resources and Agenda slide were not wireframed here due to time limit, and there are limited visual options to choose to from Basamiq, so I tryied to illustrate some of the visuals by text here. The main goal of the sketch is to walk through some interesting data stories with audience and call for action to raise the road safety awareness.

![Title Slide](Title Slide.jpeg)
![Background1](Background 1.jpeg)
![Background2](Background 2.jpeg)
In the background slide(page 3), the downward errows are representing the SUDG Road death rate goal by 2020, unfortunately I failed to choose apporpirate icons to present that and it might casue confusion.

![Analysis3](Analysis 3.jpeg)
![Summary](Summary.jpeg)
![Recommendation](Recommendation.jpeg)
The message title in recommendation slide(page 8) should be "recommendation to improve th inequality of global road safety issue." The words are filtered somehow.

# User research protocol
In the first round of interview, I reached out to 6 students who are from different academic background(business/art management/data analystics/public policy/information systems). I listed my questions in [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSchcYh5TmSVac6K1LurUegEFajmUXqztYK2rvhSyTf4ZAa-UQ/viewform?usp=pp_url) and created a review link of my wireframe, I waited for 24 hours to collect their responses. The questionaire involves three short answers and five long paragraohs. I translated some of the scripts first, then summarize key messages in a table.

| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | What is the aim of the story? |
| Paragraph | To make the readers aware of road quality in different regions. |


1. What is the aim of the story?
> To make the readers aware of road quality in different regions.
> Discover the inequality of global road safe and give recommendations to improve road safety.
> *For graduation :p*
> Showing the differences across countries and time of road traffic safety
> Inequality in road safety across regions and income groups

2.Can you describe to me what the storyline is telling you?
> It tells me which areas are better, the scatter plot describes the quality of roads, there is a trends graph showing the timeline etc. which is well made.
> The story first states the reality that road safety issue is becoming more and more important globally, then illustrates the relationship between road safety and countries' gpa index. What's more, the story points out that road traffic death situation is not the same among difference countries and their progress are not the same as well. Finally, it provides recommendations in terms of road safety issue.
> 道路安全是一个全球性的问题，在地域和收入水平间存在显著差距(Road safety issue is a global convern, it has significant difference across different regions and income levels)
> While road safety has improved in some countries and regions, others have a ways to go. 
> There is progress in road safety over. But less progress for some regions and income levels.

3. Assuming the content is complete and accurate, does the content (visualizations/text) support its title?
> Yes
> The content can support its title.
> it's pretty relevent
> Yes. Might be interesting to include a map if possible showing the differences in global road safety, maybe of road deaths per 100,000 people
> The content shows change in road safety among certain regions and income levels. The word Mapping doesnt convey the exact meaning.

4.Does the storyline flow smoothly? (please provide the rationale of the logic flaw)
> Yes, it starts from trends to the regions which face road quality issues and then goes to explain SDG goals and finally ends with recommendations
> It's smooth. It first tells the reader why road traffic issue is important and then, describe its current states using exploratory data analysis. This step make it easier to help the author and readers to find insights in the data. Finally it provide recommendations according to those insights.
> 问题很重要-现实和目标还有差距-展示不平等现象(地域和收入水平两个层次)-提出解决方案 (The problem is very important: There is still wid gap between reality and goal -> Show the inequality phenomena between income level and regions -> Propose soultion)
> Consider moving Analysis 3 (the scatterplot) to before Analysis 2 (the bar chart). It seems like you could show a wider view of each country's rate with the scatterplot, then zoom into a regional level and provide the "Interpretation of regional difference" after this
> Yes. An overview is given at first and then data is shown about how progress is not same across countries.

5. What do you think of the layout of the visuals?
> It is good. Would look amazing with color
> The layout is good, but there are many unknown symbol in the last page and in 5/6/7 pages. The author should remove them with something meaningful and useful.
love the neat layout, pretty cute font but not appropriate for such serious topic 
> Very good!
> It looks good. The text is minimal. 

6. Do you think the storyline is persuasive enough?
> Yes, it is a crucial and important topic that has been dealt well
> If I look into those pictures and data, they are persuasive, but they are not very straight forward. Those title should indicate the conclusions of the pictures, so that the readers can easily tell what you wanna see and what's your insights.
> 对于展示问题的严重性和by地域以及收入的不平等是ok的。但不足以支撑最后一个slide的结论。(it's okay to present the seriousness of th problem between region and income level, however, it's not sufficient to suppor the conclusion in the last slide.)
> Yes
> Yes

7. What're your recommendations to improve? (Please list the page)
> Addition of color to initial graphs (page 2-3 I guess)
> + The author should include some colors in the graphs, so it will be more appealing.
  + The author should replace the unknown symbols with words/graphs. 
  + The author should interpret the graphs a little besides the graphs. 
  + The author should fill the graphs with real data. 
  + The author should label the graphs.
> + "slide 3. ""Progress and SDG Goal Gap "": what is SDG? 我推测这个slide是用来支撑上一张表达问题严重性的，slide2其实很空，不如合为一张。分开的话有些模糊，一开始以为是要展示机车拥有量和事故发生率存在正相关(I assume this slide used to support the severity o the problem, bu actually it was very vague, I suggest combining them into one slide. I thought you're presenting the positiv association between vehicle number and accidents rates.)
  + slide4.左边展示的是income右边是region，但是到了后面两张slide5是region，slide6是income，建议顺序调换过来保持一致. (I suggest flipping the slide #5 and #6 to ensure the uniform sequence.)
  + slide8.真的需要这一张吗？对于现象的描述是不足以支撑这些建议的. (Do we really need those recommendations? they are not persuasive enough to support your recommendation)
> Just the map. Maybe it could go after Analysis 1
> 1.Not sure what the Progress in slides 3-6 mean. Is it improvement or the current status? Progress gives positive notation while the visuals communicate negative. 
2. Slide 7 could improved. Not sure how 3 the visual is apt for showing 3 country's status.
3. In slide 3, it doesnt differentiate which line belongs to SDG goal and progress.
4. Should legends be included for each graphs?"
